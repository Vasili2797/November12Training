Test plan:
Objective:
	Make sure program functions in all supported web browsers
	Find potential program flaws in User Interface before going online
	Simplify interaction between web browser and consumer

Test Strategy:
	See how the program functions in current version 1.0
	See if there are issues with functionalities at present
	Write single unit test cases for each new software
	Integrate all test cases with the whole project
	Start adapting based on results

Analyze the product:
	What does the product do
	What are its current functionalities
	What is the overall goal of the company with its new features
	
Scope:
In-Scope Functionalities

Nonfunctional requirements:
	The website must be able to support different web browsers on different Operating Systems
	The website must be able to provide great customer experience for multiple users simultaneously
	Website should have minimal number of crashes, and in case of it, must be able to handle properly
	Program must be versatile and adaptable to changes in algorithm or source code
	What are the effects of implementation of new features on the website as a whole 
	
Functional requirements:
	Users must be able to easily move around between pages
	All the call to action fields must work properly
	User credentials should match respectively

Out-Of-Scope Functionalities:
	Testing of the hardware and see if there is a need for update to newer technologies
	See if hardware would be able to handle additional functionalities

Integration:
	Must install all the required new packages and systems so that new software can be implemented
	All Test cases and new software must be combined and tested as a group
	If issues arise when tested collectively, they must be handled as a group
	If old features are not compatible, change it to be compatible with new features

Testing type:	
	Test should be conducted using the Agile methodology
	Design the test and write what the software should be able to handle at a given situation
	Proceed based on the results of the test and continue development process
